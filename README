Unstable Art!  Art program with experimental features.

Undo-tree: mess with time; never draw on the wrong layer again.  Auto-redraw painting in higher-res.

Building:
*  You'll need to run `mvn clean install` on https://github.com/romix/kryo/tree/kryo-2.23-continuations - it's the only code I've found that will serialize my long history chains.

Released under the MIT license.

Note: you'll probably need to clone and `mvn clean install` my util project, MathNStuff.  ( https://github.com/Erhannis/MathNStuff )
