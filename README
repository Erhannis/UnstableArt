Unstable Art!  Art program with experimental features.

Undo-tree: Mess with time; never draw on the wrong layer again.  Results in many of the other features.
Saved history: The undo-tree is recorded in your save file.
Infinite zoom: Pan and zoom as far as you want, or toggle canvas mode if you want to do pixel art or something.
Resolution-agnostic: Auto-redraw painting in higher-res.
Distributed widgets: Keep the color picker etc. open on your phone while you draw on your tablet.

Building:
*  You'll need to run `mvn clean install` on https://github.com/romix/kryo/tree/kryo-2.23-continuations - it's the only code I've found that will serialize my long history chains.
*  And also `mvn clean install` my util project, MathNStuff.  ( https://github.com/Erhannis/MathNStuff )
*  And ALSO clone and run `./gradlew clean uploadArchives` on my Android util project, EKAndroid.  ( https://github.com/Erhannis/EKAndroid.git )
